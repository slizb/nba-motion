This is the companion repository for my thesis:

The above animation was created using player tracking data that was captured at 25 frames per second during a recent NBA basketball game.  In my thesis, I use the same data to identify the game strategies that most influence three-point shooting success.  I also identify the most effective and least effective three-point shooters in the league.
